  description: "The Car Locations suite allows a user to retrieve rental car locations.\r\
    \n\r\n##Location Search\r\n\r\nThe Location Search endpoint gets a list of the\
    \ rental locations based on a specified geographic keyword or coordinates. Multiple\
    \ brands (Avis, Budget, Payless) can be specified in one request. \r\n\r\nIf a\
    \ geographic keyword is specified, the endpoint retrieves the location results\
    \ that most closely match a given keyword. This includes airport and neighborhood\
    \ rental locations. For example, if \"Boston\" is specified, then \"Boston Logan\
    \ International Airport\", \"100 Clarendon Street\", \"2 Seaport Lane\" and other\
    \ rental locations associated to the keyword will be returned. This may be used\
    \ to provide autocomplete functionality for text-based rental location searches.\
    \ \r\n\r\nIf a latitude/longitude is specified, the endpoint retrieves a list\
    \ of locations that are nearest the specified geographic coordinates.\r\n\r\n\
    The response will contain a summary about each rental location, including the\
    \ location code, address, operating hours, and latitude/longitude. \r\n\r\nWhat's\
    \ next? Use the Car Availability endpoint to retrieve basic rate and availability\
    \ information. "
