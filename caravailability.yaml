  title: Car Availability
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |-
    The Car Availability endpoint retrieves basic rate and availability information of a given rental car.

    The response contains a vehicles array with each of the available vehicles that match the search criteria. This includes the base rate, and any discount, membership, and promotional coupons applied to the rate for the reservation.

    The cars and rates returned by this endpoint are influenced by the age of the driver. The “age” or “date_of_birth” can be provided as parameters. If the “membership_code” is provided and the profile associated with that code has a valid date of birth, that will take precedence over any of the query parameters provided. The order of precedence for age calculations is: membership_code -> age -> date_of_birth.

    What's next? Use the Car Rate endpoint to get a detailed rate.
